# 1. What Is **Cloud Native Qumulo on AWS** (CNQ on AWS)?
- **CNQ on AWS** is Qumulo’s cloud offering that retains (almost) all the strengths of the on‑premises Qumulo platform.  
- **Scale‑out performance**: the more nodes you add, the more capacity and throughput you get. All provisioned space forms **one single file system**.  
  - Store up to **1.8 × 10¹⁹ files** across the cluster and up to **4.3 billion files** in a single directory.  
  - Multi‑protocol support: **NFS, SMB, S3, FTP, REST**, and more.  
- CNQ uses **EC2** instances as compute nodes and **Amazon S3** as the back‑end persistent store.  
  - **Scale‑out / in**: add or remove compute nodes.  
  - **Scale‑up / down**: swap instance types for larger or smaller ones.  
- With **Global Namespace**, you can present a unified tree that spans other CNQ clusters and on‑prem Qumulo clusters.
